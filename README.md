##Keep track of your champions' winrate, pickrate and banrate throught various websites

You gotta download a chrome driver here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads\
I did it with ChromeDriver 84.0.4147.30, but it should work with any\
Also you need install selenium (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)\
If you need anything else, need help, have suggestions or feedback or just wanna talk, hit me up\
Discord: notPlancha#1634, Reddit:u/notPlancha, Twiiter: @notplancha, email:notPlancha@gmail.com\
Idk how github really works, so if you really need something I recommend you message me anywhere else. Still you can do whatever, I don't care\
One last thing. If there's a new champion, just add it to the list anywhere.\
